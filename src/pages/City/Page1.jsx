              If you are looking for some out-of-the-city travel, the Southern
              Cross, Melbourne Central, and Flinders Street train stations
              located within the Central Business District (CBD) are also well
              connected for that purpose. There is also a network of tram
              services from the CBD to the other parts of central Melbourne.
              There is a great deal of pedestrian infrastructure in the area,
              which allows for easy sightseeing.

            <p>
              The most convenient way to travel to the CBD from Melbourne
              Airport is by using the T4 Skybus service, which operates from the
              Airport coach terminus directly to Southern Cross Station, located
              in the city centre. This service is timely, taking about forty
              minutes, such as during peak hours, which one spends in a taxi.
              Southern Cross is easy to access by tram or just a bit of a walk
              to the desired place from the Southern Cross station.
