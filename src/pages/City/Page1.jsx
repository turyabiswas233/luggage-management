            If you are looking for some out-of-the-city travel, the Southern
            Cross, Melbourne Central, and Flinders Street train stations located
            within the Central Business District (CBD) are also well connected
            for that purpose. There is also a network of tram services from the
            CBD to the other parts of central Melbourne. There is a great deal
            of pedestrian infrastructure in the area, which allows for easy

          <p>
            The most convenient way to travel to the CBD from Melbourne Airport
            is by using the T4 Skybus service, which operates from the Airport
            coach terminus directly to Southern Cross Station, located in the
            city centre. This service is timely, taking about forty minutes,
            such as during peak hours, which one spends in a taxi. Southern
            Cross is easy to access by tram or just a bit of a walk to the
            desired place from the Southern Cross station.
