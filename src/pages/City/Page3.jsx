            How to Use Urloker for Luggage Storage at Flinders Street Station
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is very easy to use Urloker for any luggage storage facility
            within the Flinders Street Station. Generally, most providers of
            luggage storage have a very easy way of storing and collecting the
            stored luggage. This is how it usually works:
          </p>
          <ul className="px-5 list-disc">
            <li>
              <b>Online Booking or On-the-Spot Service:</b> It is possible to
              make an online reservation for some of the luggage storage areas.
              This is to ensure that a locker will be available when you turn up
              such as during the peak seasons. Alternatively, you can avail of
              the on-the-spot service by physically going to the storage
              facility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Drop Off Your Luggage:</b> As soon as you reach Flinders street
              station you do not have to worry about carrying any of your
              luggage around, simply go to the luggage storage area which is
              clearly marked out on the station. Follow the steps to lock away
              the bag in the locker or hand it over to the attendant lady if it
              is a proper luggage storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Payment Options:</b> Many payment methods are accepted from a
              person who wishes to pay for the storage; credit cards, debit
              cards and now mobile money transfer applications. Storage of bags
              attracts a timewise duration based price rather than a flat rate
              with some firms going the extra mile in offering a discount on
              bags storage court of at least a week.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Retrieve Your Belongings :</b> In case one chooses to reclaim
              his or her bag, one lifts his disposition and walks up to the
              storage room, types the access code and/or positive identification
              or payment receipt and opens up the locker whose content needs to
              be retrieved.
