          <h3>1. GENERAL</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              1.1. Bounce provides an online platform for Partners who have
              available storage space at their Partnering Location(s) to connect
              with Customers who wish to store their Property. The Bounce
              Platform also allows Partners who have available storage space at
              their Partnering Location(s) to connect with Customers who wish to
              have their package(s) delivered, accepted, and picked up at such
              locations.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              1.2. Bounce will use its best efforts to promote the availability
              of the Services offered at the Partnering Location(s) on the
              Bounce Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              1.3. These terms and conditions (the “Terms”) cover your access
              and use of the Bounce Platform. You must read carefully and agree
              to the Terms prior to accessing and using Bounce Platform. Your
              agreement to these Terms establishes a legal agreement between you
              and Bounce. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or
              arrangements between you and Bounce. Each of Bounce and Partner is
              referred to in these Terms as a “Party” and collectively as “the
              Parties”.
            </li>
            <li>
              1.4. These Terms apply to the extent they do not conflict with any
              other terms that specifically apply to the Services. From time to
              time, you may be asked to agree to additional terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              1.5. Subject to these Terms, Bounce appoints Partner as its
              non-exclusive representative to perform Services for Bounce and
              Customers at Partnering Location(s) and to market and promote the
              Services as a provider of such Services. Nothing in this agreement
              shall restrict Bounce from appointing any third party to provide
              services that are similar to the Services or to market, promote,
              identify, and refer potential customers for any services.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <h3>2. GENERAL OBLIGATIONS</h3>
            <li>
              2.1. To be displayed on Bounce Platform, Partners must provide
              Bounce with all information and materials reasonably necessary to
              complete a profile of a Partner and Partnering Location(s) on
              Bounce Platform, including the Partner's logo, email address, a
              description, and pictures of the Partnering Location(s), hours of
              operation, and other useful information Bounce may request from
              time to time (collectively the “Profile Information”).
            </li>
            <li>
              2.2. Each Partner is responsible for all information made
              available to Customers about the Partnering Location(s) and is
              responsible to ensure that this information remains up to date at
              all times. Partners must notify Bounce and Customers about opening
              hours and/or any other relevant information, including but not
              limited to, a change of opening hours, permanent or temporary
              closure of Partnering Location(s), or cancellation of its Bounce
              Partner’s account.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.3. If a Partner modifies its opening hours and this affects or
              will affect an existing or future Booking, the Partner must
              immediately contact Bounce at partnersupport@usebounce.com. If a
              Partnering location is closed when a Customer arrives or if a
              Partner otherwise fails to fulfill its obligations under an
              existing Booking, including but not limited to, closing earlier
              than the advertised time and holding up Customer’s property at a
              Partnering Location, the defaulting Partner will not receive any
              Commission or other fee(s) for this Booking. The defaulting
              Partner may also be liable to Bounce for costs associated with its
              unfulfilled obligations under an existing Booking. These costs may
              include but are not limited to, the cost of shipping Customer’s
              Property to Customer’s location and related claims coming from a
              Customer who was not able to retrieve its Property due to
              Partner’s failure to fulfill its obligations under an existing
              Booking.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.3.1. If the Commission has already been paid, the defaulting
              Partner will be liable for an amount equivalent to the payable
              Commission and/or other fee(s) and/or costs associated with its
              unfulfilled obligations which may be set off against, and deducted
              from the next Commission and/or other fee(s) payable to the
              defaulting Partner or from Commission(s) and/or other fee(s) which
              were already paid to the defaulting Partner.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.3.2. If the Commission has not been paid yet, the defaulting
              Partner will be liable for an amount equivalent to the payable
              Commission and/or other fee(s) and/or cost(s) associated with its
              unfulfilled obligations which may be set off against, and deducted
              from existing Commission or other fee(s) payable to the defaulting
              Partner.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.3.3. Bounce also reserves its right to cancel the defaulting
              Partner’s account in case a Partner fails to fulfill its
              obligations under an existing Booking.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.4. Each Partner acknowledges and agrees that it will (i) not
              participate in any third-party service, website, app, or platform
              that offers the same or similar Services as Bounce and/or (ii) set
              up its own service, website, app or platform that offers the same
              or similar Services as Bounce while it is bound by this agreement
              and up to one (1) year after the termination of this agreement by
              either Party.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.5. Each Partner acknowledges and agrees that it will not provide
              Services to any person introduced by Bounce other than through the
              Bounce Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.6. Partner shall not make any inaccurate statements concerning
              the quality, performance, or other characteristics of the Bounce
              Platform or the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.7. If Partner breaches Sections 2.4, 2.5, and/or 2.6, without
              prejudice to any other rights or remedies it may have, Bounce may
              decide to (i) move Partner to a lower level and/or (ii) require
              the full refund of the Commission(s) or other fee(s) paid or
              payable to Partner by Bounce and/or (iii) cancel the Bounce
              Partner’s account immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.8. Partners will use their best efforts to promote the
              availability of the Services at the Partnering Location(s),
              including by prominently posting Marketing Materials provided by
              Bounce for such purpose, subject to reasonable size and format
              constraints.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.8.1. Partners will be provided with reasonable quantities of
              Marketing Materials as Bounce deems necessary for proper
              promotions and sales presentations of the Services at Partnering
              location(s). Partners agree to not alter Marketing Materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.8.2. Marketing Materials remain the property of Bounce and shall
              be returned to Bounce upon its request. If Marketing Materials are
              not returned promptly after Bounce made such a request, Partners
              must either (i) return Marketing Materials to Bounce and pay for
              the fee(s) associated with such return or (ii) ask Bounce to come
              and pick up all Marketing Materials at the Partnering Location(s)
              and pay for the costs associated with such pick-up.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.9. Any behavior involving violence, sexual misconduct,
              harassment, fraud, discrimination, deceptive, illegal, or unsafe
              activity while using Bounce Platform can result in the immediate
              loss of your access to Bounce Platform. When law enforcement is
              involved, Bounce will use its best efforts to cooperate with their
              investigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.9.1. Fraudulent activity may include but is not limited to
              creating dummy accounts for fraudulent purposes; claiming
              fraudulent Commission(s) and/or fee(s) or charge(s); intentionally
              requesting fraudulent or falsified Bookings; actions intended to
              disrupt or manipulate the normal functioning of Bounce Platform,
              disputing Commission(s) and/or fee(s) or charge(s) for fraudulent
              or illegitimate reasons; creating improper duplicate accounts; or
              falsifying documents, records, or other data for fraudulent
              purposes.

          <ol>
            <h3>3. Safety AND Security</h3>
            <li>
              3.1. Partners will use their best efforts to ensure the safety and
              security of Customer Property stored at Partnering Location(s) and
              will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection
              with the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              3.2 Customers shall not use the services in relation to any
              Prohibited Items, as listed in the Terms and Conditions. Partners
              may inspect Customer Property and/or package(s) in the Customer’s
              presence and may require Customers to certify that their Property
              or package(s) does not include any Prohibited Items listed in the
              Terms of Service. If the Partner has reason to believe that
              Customer Property is or contains a Prohibited Item, the Partner
              may reject such Customer Property or refuse to collect such
              package in its reasonable discretion and without responsibility to
              Customer. The Partner must immediately report such rejection and
              the reason for such rejection to Bounce, along with any other
              suspicious activity Partner identifies with respect to Customer
              Property, Partner’s safety, and/or security by contacting
              admin@urloker.com.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <li>
              4.1. Partners agree to maintain a high standard of quality for the
              Services. A high standard of quality includes but is not limited
              to maintaining high Customer ratings and a high number of
              satisfactory Customer reviews, having a low number of unserved
              Customers, and not accepting unreserved bookings.
            </li>
            <li>
              4.2. Every month Partners will be assessed based on objective
              criteria, including but not limited to those described above, and
              will be assigned to a Partner Level (Level 1, Level 2, and Level
              3).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <h3>5. PAYMENT, COMMISSION, AND FEE</h3>
            <li>
              5.1. Partners explicitly agree that all financial transactions
              between the Parties will be processed by Stripe, a third-party
              electronic money institution that provides a payment system,
              embedded in the Bounce Platform. Payment processing services for
              Partners are provided by Stripe and are subject to Stripe
              Connected Account Management, which includes the Stripe Terms of
              Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). Partners
              are required to complete the Stripe Connect Onboarding and shall
              add their payment and business details into Stripe to allow for
              the direct deposit of Commission(s) and other fee(s) relating to
              the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              5.2. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to be bound by the
              Stripe Services Agreement. You agree to provide Bounce with
              accurate and complete information about you, and your business and
              you authorize us to share information related to your use of the
              payment processions services provided by Stripe.
            </li>
            <li>
              5.3. Bounce is not regulated by any financial supervisory
              authority. All payment services that require an authorization,
              license, or registration are provided by Stripe. Bounce is not a
              payment services provider in the terms defined by Directive (EU)
              2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25
              November 2015 on payment services in the internal market (“PSD2”).
              Bounce acts as a technical service provider, by supporting, via
              the Bounce Platform, the provision of payment services by Stripe,
              in the terms defined by Article 3(j) PDS2.
            </li>
            <li>
              5.4. The right to receive the respective Commission(s) and other
              fee(s) is earned after a Customer completes payment for the
              Service(s) and after Partner has performed the Service(s). To the
              extent permitted by law, any Customer chargebacks will result in
              the reversal of payment and associated chargeback fees. In no
              event shall Bounce be obligated to reimburse Partners for any
              expenses incurred by Partners in performing their obligations
              under these Terms other than the ones Bounce agreed to cover.

              5.5. Provided that Partners have fully completed the Stripe
              Connect Onboarding, entered their payment and business details
              into Stripe, and respected their obligations under these Terms and
              any other applicable terms, the payment of Commission(s) and other
              fee(s), are made to Partners at the beginning of each month.
              Commission(s) and other fee(s) will be paid in the agreed-upon
              currency and subject to all applicable laws and regulations.

            <li>
              5.6. Partners allow Bounce to make allowances and adjustments and
              write off Partners’ accounts as debts via Stripe in each case as
              Bounce deems advisable. To the extent permitted by law, Partners
              agree that Bounce may charge back to Partners’ Stripe account any
              amounts previously paid or credited to it with respect to such
              allowances, adjustments, or debts.

              their payment terminal, or means of payment other than the ones
              authorized by Bounce. Any breach of this Section may result in the
              cancellation of your Bounce account.

              5.8. If Partner is found by Bounce to be knowingly involved in the
              acceptance or solicitation of payment directly from Customers,
              outside Bounce Platform, Partner agrees to pay Bounce the
              corresponding Commission that would have been due had the Booking
              been conducted in accordance with these Terms. Partners may be
              liable to compensate Bounce for damages associated with the
              acceptance or solicitation of payment directly from Customers,
              outside the Bounce Platform.

            <li>
              6.1. Partner may accept and securely store Property from Customers
              who have purchased this Service through the Bounce Platform at
              Partnering Location(s).
            </li>
            <li>
              6.2. When requested by Customer to accept and securely store
              Customer Property, Partner will (i) verify Customer’s reservation
              by confirming the Booking confirmation sent by Bounce to the
              Partner; (ii) check Customer in on Bounce Platform; (iii) attach a
              printed tag(s) to the Customer Property; (iii) rip the bottom of
              such tag(s) and give it to Customer; (iv) store such Customer
              Property in a secure location; (v) check Customer out on Bounce
              Platform and (v) return Customer Property in the same condition as
              it was received to Customer upon Customer’s request and
              presentation of the relevant tag(s) bottoms. Exceptionally,
              Partners may have to transfer Customer Property to Bounce or its
              authorized courier for transportation, per Bounce’s instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
              6.3. Partners may accept and securely store Customer Property at a

              https://usebounce.com to place a booking or ask Customer to scan a
              QR code to record the booking. Section 6(2) remains fully

              booked (before entering the Partnering Location or directly at the
              Partnering Location) and registered via Bounce Platform. Accepting
              and storing Customer Property without any records in the Bounce
              Platform will be considered a breach of these Terms. Doing so also
              exposes Partners to liability as the Bag Protection will not apply
              to Customer Property that has not been booked and registered via
              Bounce Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              6.4.1. If Partners accept an unbooked and unregistered Customer
              Property, Bounce reserves its right to move Partners to a lower
              level and/or to delist Partners.

            <li>
              6.4.2. If Partner accepts an unbooked and unregistered Customer
              Property, Bounce also reserves its right, at its sole discretion,
              to remove the Bag Protection for all Bookings made at the same
              time at the Partnering Location.
            </li>
            <li>
              6.5. Partners shall be entitled to a Commission for each
              Customer’s use of this Service at the Partnering Location and
              provided that these Terms are respected.
            </li>
            <li>
              6.6. Partners have the right to dispose of any Customer Property
              left behind after the Customer's designated check-out date and
              time if no contact has not been made by Customer within three (3)
              business days. Partners understand and agree that Bounce is not
              responsible for any compensation to Partners in the event that
              Partners decide to retain such Property.
