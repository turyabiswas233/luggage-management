            Exploring the Melbourne CBD
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you are looking for some out-of-the-city travel, the Southern
            Cross, Melbourne Central, and Flinders Street train stations
            located within the Central Business District (CBD) are also well
            connected for that purpose. There is also a network of tram
            services from the CBD to the other parts of central Melbourne.
            There is a great deal of pedestrian infrastructure in the area,
            which allows for easy sightseeing.

            Melbourne CBD Getting from the Airport to the CBD
          </h4>
          <p>
            The most convenient way to travel to the CBD from Melbourne
            Airport is by using the T4 Skybus service, which operates from the
            Airport coach terminus directly to Southern Cross Station, located
            in the city centre. This service is timely, taking about forty
            minutes, such as during peak hours, which one spends in a taxi.
            Southern Cross is easy to access by tram or just a bit of a walk
            to the desired place from the Southern Cross station.

            line connection to some areas in metropolitan Melbourne and its
            suburbs.
