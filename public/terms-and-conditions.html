        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            1.1.Urloker provides an online platform (the "Urloker Platform") to
            eligible users ("Customers") who wish to store their personal items
            on a short-term basis, enabling them to find and book available
            storage spaces and services from partners who offer short-term
            storage at their locations, along with other services ("Partners").
            Customers may also connect with Partners to have their packages
            delivered and accepted at some Partners' locations using the Urloker
            Platform. In these Terms, item(s), personal item(s), bag(s),
            luggage(s), and package(s) are collectively referred to as
            "Item(s)."
          </li>
          <li>
            1.2. Urloker operates the Urloker Platform, which allows Customers
            to connect with Partners at the physical locations they manage and
            control ("Partnering Location(s)") in relation to the following
            services facilitated by us (collectively, the "Services"):
          </li>

          <li>
            1.2.1. Storage Service: Customers may find and book available
            short-term storage space for their Items ("Storage Service").
          </li>

          <li>
            1.2.2. Transportation Service: Customers may find and book
            transportation of their Items between Partnering Location(s), their
            home, or other designated locations ("Transportation Service").
          </li>

          <li>
            1.2.3. Package Acceptance Service: Customers may have their packages
            received, accepted by Partners, and delivered at some Partnering
            Locations ("Package Acceptance Service").
          </li>

          <li>
            1.2.4. Other Services: From time to time, Urloker may allow
            Customers to use the Urloker Platform to connect with Partners in
            relation to other services ("Other Services"). We will use our best
            efforts to notify you about these Other Services and the conditions
            attached to them via the Urloker Platform. We will notify you about
            any material changes to these Terms to reflect which Other Services
            you can access and use via the Urloker Platform.
          </li>

          <li>
            1.3. These Terms, including, without limitation, the UrlokerShield™
            Protection, will only apply to the Services and only to the extent
            they are concluded exclusively via the Urloker Platform, and all
            interactions between you and the Partner occur via the Urloker
            Platform.
          </li>

          <li>
            1.4. Any products and services provided to you by a Partner outside
            the Urloker Platform are not subject to these Terms. Those products
            and services are priced locally by Partners and are subject to
            separate terms with Partners. You must pay Partners directly for
            such products and services at the time of purchase or provision of
            those products or services. However, from time to time, we may allow
            you to buy products and services from Partners and to pay for these
            using the Urloker Platform.
          </li>
          l
          <li>
            1.5. Urloker does not own, control, or manage Partnering Locations.
            Urloker is not a party to any contracts that may be entered into
            between Customers and Partners, nor is Urloker a payment provider, a
            broker, or an insurer.

            when you purchase the first subscription to the applicable
            subscription service. Your account will be charged automatically on
            the Subscription Billing Date for all applicable fees for the next
            subscription period. Your subscription will continue unless and
            until you cancel it or if we terminate this agreement in accordance
            with Section 13. You must cancel your subscription before it renews
            to avoid the billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your
            account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment
            method you provided us with.

          <li>
            5.1. Urloker may, at its sole discretion, compensate you for lost,

            5.2. In relation to the storage service, Urloker will automatically
            charge a fee for UrlokerShield™ Protection. The UrlokerShield™

            (€1000 in the EU, or £1000 in the UK or any other applicable
            currency), considering your item’s initial value as well as any loss
            caused by wear and tear. You understand and agree that Urloker will
            not reimburse you for the replacement of the item(s). The
            compensated value will be decided by Urloker based on the evidence
            provided by you and individual circumstances. You understand and
            agree that the UrlokerShield™ Protection is offered at Urloker's
            sole discretion. Urloker may reject your claim regardless of

            customers or items that are easily subject to damages despite
            reasonable handling and packaging. This includes but is not limited
            to vases, fragile glass items, art paintings, photos, liquids,
            electronic devices such as laptops or phones without a case, cover,

          </li>

            abandoned and are no longer covered by the UrlokerShield™
            Protection. Some partners may require that abandoned items are

            compensating party to us. Failure to do so may result in the claim
            being rejected.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.6. We may ask you to cooperate and communicate with relevant
            parties, such as the relevant partner and law enforcement, in
            resolving a claim. We may also ask you to cooperate with the partner
            and their affiliates in connection with all security measures that
            are currently in place in the partnering location and that may be in
            place in the future, relating to the handling, storage, retrieval,
            and shipping of items. “Affiliates” in these terms refer both to
            Urloker's affiliates as part of Urloker's affiliate program and
            partners' affiliates.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.7. To activate compensation under the UrlokerShield™ Protection in

          <li>
            5.7.1. Customers must have a valid booking for storage service for
            their item(s) and must be able to show valid proof of payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.7.2. Customers must demonstrate that they (a) made a booking via
            the Urloker platform and that all their interactions with partners
            were made exclusively via the Urloker platform; (b) took a photo of
            each tagged item at the time of check-in and (c) followed any other
            on-screen instructions. Failure to complete any of these steps may
            void the application of the UrlokerShield™ Protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.7.3. Customers must notify Urloker about the stolen, lost, or
            damaged item(s) for which they wish to invoke the protection by
            sending us an email at support@urloker.com within twenty-four (24)
            hours of the scheduled end of the booking.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.7.4. Customers must share with Urloker all relevant details
            regarding the exact item(s) stored in the bag(s), luggage(s), etc.
            linked to the booking. This includes the condition of the item(s)
            immediately before they were stored, the condition at the time you
            retrieved the item(s), and the value of each item included in the
            claim.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.7.5. Provide evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the item was
            stolen, damaged, or lost while being stored as part of the storage
            service. This may include police reports, receipts, video footage,
            and other evidence we may ask you to provide. Failure to provide
            adequate documentation of the requirements listed above may
            automatically give grounds for a rejection of the claim. Whether or
            not the evidence provided is to be considered adequate will be
            decided at Urloker’s sole discretion.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.8. The UrlokerShield™ Protection is currently not available for
            package acceptance service, and Urloker will not reimburse you for

        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            7.1. For each item stored, you must (a) make a booking via the
            Urloker platform or scan the QR code available at the partnering
            location. This QR code will allow you to access the Urloker platform
            for you to make a booking directly on the Urloker platform; (b) take
            a photo of each tagged item at the time of check-in and (c) follow
            any other on-screen instructions on the Urloker platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            7.2. Your booking for storage service includes the storage of your
            item(s) during the period specified in your booking (“Storage
            Period”). You are responsible for retrieving your item(s) from the
            partner before the end of the storage period and providing
            reasonable proof that the item(s) belong to you or that you have
            sufficient authority to retrieve the item(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            7.3. At the end of the storage period, if your item has not been
            claimed, you understand and agree that Urloker may extend your
            booking for storage service at the then-applicable rate to cover the
            full period that your item is in the possession of the partner,
            whether or not you receive notice from us or the partner. You must
            contact Urloker to arrange for the recovery of your item(s). If the
            payment attempt to extend your reservation fails, if you are
            unreachable by Urloker or the partner, or if you don’t manage to
            successfully contact Urloker or the partner, the partner may dispose
            of your item(s) at its sole discretion. You understand and agree
            that the partner may take the above-described actions with respect
            to your items and waive any and all claims you may have against the
            partner, its franchisor, or any of their affiliates or other related
            entities.
          </li>
          <li>
            7.4. Cancellations must be done before the check-in time of the
            booking or one (1) hour after that check-in time. Valid cancellation
            requests will be refunded in Urloker credits or via the payment
            method used for the booking. Urloker credits can be used for future
            reservations at any partnering location.

            8.3. You agree that partners have the right to reject any package
            that they are uncomfortable accepting, including oversized packages.
            You agree not to send any oversized packages, including mattresses
            or appliances, or anything weighing more than 25 lbs (or any
            applicable weight limit) without prior written approval from Urloker
            and the partner. If a partner accepts your oversized package, you
            agree that you may still be charged an oversized package fee as
            described in Section 4.5.6.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.4. You agree that if you sign up for the unlimited plan, Urloker

          </li>
          <li>
            8.5. You understand and agree that a partner may decide at any time
            to stop offering the package acceptance service to you at its sole
            discretion. If that’s the case, we will contact you.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.6. You agree that Urloker or the partner is not liable for any

            item(s) that were later misplaced.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.7. If your package was not picked up by the booking check-out
            time, it is considered abandoned. In this case, Urloker may ship it
            to your address. If so, you must reimburse us for the shipping cost
            incurred and a late pick-up fee as described in Section 4.5.5.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.8. Cancellations must be done before the package arrives at the
            partnering location. Valid cancellation requests will be refunded in
            Urloker credits or via the payment method used for the booking.
            Urloker credits can be used for future reservations at any
            partnering location.

            11.2. Each provision of these Terms that provides for a limitation
            of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is
            intended to and does allocate the risks between the Parties under
            these Terms. This allocation is an essential element of the basis of
            the bargain between the Parties. Each of these provisions is
            severable and independent of all other provisions of these Terms.
            The limitations in this section will apply even if any limited
            remedy fails for its essential purpose. Any claim for loss,
            mishandling, theft, or conversion of, or damage to, an Item shall be
            filed directly with Urloker and not the Partner or its Affiliates.
            You acknowledge and agree that your primary remedy for any loss,
            mishandling, theft, conversion of, or damage to the Item(s) stored
            is to file a claim with Urloker as set forth in these Terms.

        <p>
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with
          California law. If you are acting as a consumer and if mandatory
          statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence
          contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions
          shall apply irrespective of the choice of California law. As a
          consumer, you may bring any judicial proceedings relating to these
          Terms before the competent court of your place of residence. If
          Urloker wishes to enforce any of its rights against you as a consumer,
          we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a
          resident.

          <li>
            17.1. This Section only applies to you if your country of residence
            or establishment is the United States. In the interest of resolving
            disputes between you and Urloker in the most expedient and
            cost-effective manner, you and Urloker agree that every dispute
            arising in connection with these Terms, the Urloker Platform, or the
            Services will be resolved between you and Urloker by binding
            arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.
            Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury,
            may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be
            subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the
            same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to
            arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to
            the Urloker Platform, Services, or to any aspect of these Terms,
            whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation,
            or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises
            during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and
            agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Urloker are each
            waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
            action, and you are waiving any and all claims against the Partners
            and their Affiliates arising out of or in connection with, or
            relating to, the Urloker Platform or the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.2. Nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or
            otherwise limit the right of you or Urloker to (a) bring an
            individual action against the other in small claims court; (b)
            pursue an enforcement action against the other through the
            applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is
            available; (c) seek injunctive relief against the other in a court
            of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit against the other
            in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement
            claim.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.3. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration,
            you may opt out of the provisions of this Section within thirty (30)
            days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a
            letter to Urloker, Inc., Attention: Legal Department - Arbitration
            Opt-Out, [Insert Address] that specifies your full legal name, the
            email address associated with your account, and a statement that you
            wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Urloker
            receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section will be void and any
            action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in
            Section 16. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be
            affected by your Opt-Out Notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.4. Any arbitration between you and Urloker will be settled under
            the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American
            Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules
            (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA
            Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by
            calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Urloker. The
            arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating
            to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this
            binding arbitration agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.5. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a
            written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.
            Mail or by overnight courier (signature required) or, only if that
            other party has not provided a current physical address, then by
            electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Urloker's address for
            Notice is: Urloker, Inc., [Insert Address]. The Notice of
            Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
            dispute, and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
            The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim
            directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so
            within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Arbitration is received,
            you or Urloker may commence an arbitration proceeding. All
            arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential
            unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the
            arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or
            Urloker must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
            arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the
            arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written
            settlement amount offered by Urloker in settlement of the dispute
            prior to the award, Urloker will pay to you the higher of (i) the
            amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $1000.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.6. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms,
            Urloker will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee,
            unless your claim is for more than $1000, in which case the payment
            of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration
            hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in [Insert
            City, California], but if the claim is for $1000 or less, you may
            choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the
            basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a
            non-appearance-based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person
            hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of
            your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the
            substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
            frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
            standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then
            the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that
            case, you agree to reimburse Urloker for all monies previously
            disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the
            AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
            conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision
            sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
            which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may
            make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and
            reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding
            and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of
            the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.7. You and Urloker agree that each may bring claims against the
            other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff
            or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
            Further, unless both you and Urloker agree otherwise, the arbitrator
            may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not
            otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
            proceeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.8. If Urloker makes any future change to this arbitration
            provision, other than a change to Urloker's address for Notice of
            Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice
            within thirty (30) days of the change to Urloker's address for
            Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Urloker will
            be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in
            effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will survive.
            Enforceability. If part or the entirety of this Section is found to
            be unenforceable, or if Urloker receives an Opt-Out Notice from you,
            then the entirety of this Section will be null and void and, in that
            case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16
            will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. By
            accepting these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
